# Final List of Requirements

## Functional Requirements 

1. Creating an account for the user 

- The user must be able to create a profile using their email and a password for the creation of their profile, necessary to enter the application.  

  

2. User login 

- If the user has an account in the application, they will be able to log in by entering the email and password related to that account.

- The user's profile can be fully updated to any change that the user would like to make. 

  

5. Recipe leaks according to the user 

- Based on the information collected from the user's profile, the AI will be able to search for recipes by applying the necessary filters according to the restrictions and specifications of the user on their profile. 

  

6. How AI works 

- The AI will be able to collect the information of each recipe from the database, to perform the filters applied by the user. 

  

7. AI Feedback & Continuous Learning 

- Users will be able to provide feedback on functions involving AI, indicating whether it performed its role adequately. The purpose of this feedback will be to maintain and improve the quality of the product in the future, sticking more closely to the needs of the users. 

  

8. Integration of available ingredients 

- The system will have a function that allows users to enter the ingredients they have at home. With this, the AI will adjust the recipe search based on these unique ingredients entered by the user. 

  

9. Optimizing portions in recipes 

- The system will have a function capable of adjusting the proportions of the recipe defined by the user to adapt the appropriate amount of each ingredient to be used (amount for one or more people). This will allow maximizing the consumption of each recipe according to the user, thus optimizing the portions of the ingredients, and thus minimizing the waste of the ingredients used.

To do this, the user will have to record the hours in which he is busy within the application option, so that the AI shows the most effective recipe options to make according to the schedule that the user must cook. 
 

## Non-Functional Requirements 

1. Database with recipe information 

- The system will have a database where the information on the necessary ingredients of each recipe is stored. 

- The database will have information on the cost of each ingredient based on the prices of the "smart basket", maintaining the constant updating of the information at the time of price changes. 

2. App Portability
