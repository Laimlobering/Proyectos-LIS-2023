# Constructive criticism of the course


First of all, we want to acknowledge the focus of the Software Engineering Fundamentals course for addressing topics essential to the training of future software engineers like us. The inclusion of the comparison between the ANIEI Curricular Model and the FMAT LIS curriculum with another local or national CONAIC-accredited Software Engineering program in the first activity is a good starting point for understanding the context and perspectives of the field we were going to study.

The introduction to development phases and life cycle models, as well as the exploration of estimation, quality, and configuration models in PD2 and PD3, respectively, provided us a comprehensive overview of key aspects of software engineering. These topics are crucial for students like us to gain a solid understanding of how to approach software projects from start to finish, considering fundamental aspects such as quality and configuration management.

We think that the focus on practice through the completion of a project divided into three deliverables is an excellent way to apply the concepts we learned in class. The development of all different elements in the project (without carrying out the project in its entirely) allowed us to understand and apply the concepts seen.

However, one aspect we think that could be improved is the feedback process. As a team, we have noted that it would be more beneficial to receive feedback on the first deliverable before starting on the second. In our perspective, providing early feedback allows us to correct potential errors.

In summary, we think the course addresses the essential fundamentals of software engineering and provides valuable hands-on experience through the project. Our only suggestion is to improve the feedback process between deliverables.
