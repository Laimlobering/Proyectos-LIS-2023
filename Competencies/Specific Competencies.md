|-|-|
|Analyzes the disciplinary evolution of Software Engineering and the characteristics of professionals associated with it, according to the theoretical framework and curricular models of the discipline. |Activity: Choice of software development methodology. Justification: By making a review of the methodologies we can understand the evolution of approaches in software development, helping us to make the best decision for the methodology to apply in our project. 
|Analyzes the main methods, techniques, procedures, and best practices used in the phases of requirements, design, coding, testing, and maintenance of software, according to the recognized body of knowledge in the discipline.|Activity: Evaluation of best practices for each phase of the software life cycle. Justification: This evaluation allows us to select methods and practices that best fit our needs, ensuring a more efficient implementation aligned with recognized standards in the discipline. In such a way that we can apply what best suits us at each stage of our software development process. 
|Selects the Software Life Cycle Model at the beginning of a project based on the characteristics of the development team, the client, and the issues. |Activity: Evaluation of life cycle models and selection of the most appropriate one. Justification: The choice of the appropriate lifecycle model is made after evaluating the specific needs of the project. This activity helped us to reflect and have a better understanding of the lifecycle model depending on what we need. 
|Analyzes the main methods, techniques, procedures, and best practices used in the processes of estimation, planning, monitoring, control, quality, and configuration of software, according to the recognized body of knowledge in the discipline.|Activity: Detailed development of a project plan. Justification: By applying recognized methods, we ensure accurate planning, efficient follow-up and quality control, essential elements for project success according to recognized standards in the discipline. We were also able to get a better idea of the different methods and processes involved. 
|Identifies the key human factors influencing the success or failure of software processes, according to the theoretical framework of the discipline.|Activity: Identification of risks and human factors during project planning. Justification: During our planning sessions, we analized potential risks and human factors that could influence the success or failure of our project. Identifying these elements allowed us to develop preventive measures. By basing on the theoretical framework of the discipline, we seek to ensure effective management of human aspects, such as communication, motivation and collaboration, in order to achieve a cohesive team and a successful project.
