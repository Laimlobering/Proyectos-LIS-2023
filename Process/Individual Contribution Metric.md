# Individual Contribution Metric

For the metric of the final delivery we decided to use a scale from 1 to 3 as suggested, with 1 representing simple tasks or tasks that are done quickly, 2 representing tasks that are more complex and time consuming, and 3 representing tasks that require a lot of time and effort. Likewise, some tasks that we considered time consuming were assigned to several team members even considering the point scale we used.

**Team members**
- Jesús Alberto Aviles Castillo	
- Karen Patricia Martinez Montemayor
- Ary Obed Tzab Tzab	
- José Francisco Montero Uc	
- Mauricio Eduardo Rodriguez Aguirre
- Cesar Adrian Dominguez Franco
