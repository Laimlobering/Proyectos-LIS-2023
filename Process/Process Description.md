# Process Description

In this delivery it was clearer how the project was going, we realized that in the previous deliveries we were eating time, so in this one we opted to take use of SCRUM sprints. That is, we took a waterfall method process, but we used some things from the Scrum method, since this is more flexible for the team's work method, because if there was a problem, we could go back to the error, since we are rescuing knowledge from this project.

We followed the linear scrum process, and the following steps were followed:
1. Requirements definition: As mentioned later, we first planned and refined the requirements.
2.	Design: We refined the prototypes, for the subsequent testing of them.
3.	Implementation: In our case nothing was coded.
4.	Tests: Informal tests were made, from which we obtained a series of data that would be useful for us.
5.	Deployment: In these tests and in a previous delivery, surveys were made to know if it would be feasible.

We started with the requirements, to have the basis of the whole project and to have a clearer objective, so that later this point does not affect us, and the other activities were done in the order of the waterfall method, but with the rhythm of the SCRUM method. 

Regarding the SCRUM method, we used the Backlog system for the organization and distribution of tasks, in order to be able to carry out the Sprints and have a better management of the tasks.

## SPRINT NUMBER 1

Sprint Size: 6 days
November 20, 2023 to November 25, 2023.

Planning

For this Sprint we started to divide the activities to know what each one was going to do and organize the team, we realized that the requirements needed to be improved and/or eliminate some, so we took some time to do it, in order to get to the next Sprint. This sprint was more to establish the basis for this delivery. Regarding the meetings, one was established, in which we talked about all of the above, but focusing more on the division of labor.
