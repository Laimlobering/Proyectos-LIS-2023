# Process Management

During the time spent creating artifacts and requirements for our project, however the artifact to highlight is the individual contribution metric in which it was strictly organized for each person to fulfill their designated activities. Likewise the scores for each activity are given by ourselves through mobile communication (Whatsapp) where we vote to assign the weight of each labor.

During the project we met a few times via teams to reach work agreements and discuss how we would proceed with each activity. These meetings also served to clarify doubts among us.
