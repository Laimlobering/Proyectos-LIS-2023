# Process Management

During the time spent creating artifacts and requirements for our project, however the artifact to highlight is the individual contribution metric in which it was strictly organized for each person to fulfill their designated activities. Likewise the scores for each activity are given by ourselves through mobile communication (Whatsapp) where we vote to assign the weight of each labor.

During the project we met a few times via teams to reach work agreements and discuss how we would proceed with each activity. These meetings also served to clarify doubts among us.

in addition to the team meetings in teams only, weekly meetings were also held with the teacher to resolve doubts, present progress and receive corrections in order to continue with a positive development and improve our artifacts.

However, our main form of contact was Whatsapp, let's say that 70% of the resolutions were given by that means: Agreements, conflicts and their resolutions as well as date establishments.
It is for this reason that in a certain way we failed to take advantage of all the tools that were available, besides, by organizing in this way we simply drowned even more in our own chaos.
