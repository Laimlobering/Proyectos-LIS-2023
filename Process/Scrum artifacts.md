# Scrum Methodology
Scrum is an agile framework.  The Scrum methodology is based on agile principles and provides a structured approach to project management, allowing continuous adaptation to changing requirements and maximizing the efficiency of the development team.

The Scrum methodology is based on several key concepts that define its agile framework.  Here are the fundamental concepts of Scrum:
Product Owner:
Responsible for defining and prioritizing Product Backlog items.
Represents stakeholder interests and makes decisions about product scope and features.

**Scrum Master:**
Facilitates the Scrum process and eliminates obstacles that may affect the team.
Fosters a collaborative work environment and helps the team understand and apply Scrum principles and practices.

**Development team:**
Cross-functional, self-organized professionals who work together to deliver a product increment at the end of each Sprint.
They make decisions about how to carry out the work and are responsible for the delivery of the product.

**Product Backlog:**
A prioritized list of all features, functionality, improvements, and fixes that are planned to be implemented in the product.
It is owned by the Product Owner, who updates and prioritizes it regularly.

**Sprint:**
A short, fixed period of time (generally 2 to 4 weeks) during which a potentially deliverable product increment is developed.
At the end of each Sprint, a functional product increment must be delivered.

**Sprint Planning:**
Meeting at the beginning of each Sprint where the Product Backlog tasks that will be addressed during the Sprint are selected and planned.

**Daily Scrum:**
Daily 15-minute meeting for the development team to synchronize their activities and plan work for the next 24 hours.

**Sprint Review:**
Meeting at the end of each Sprint where the team shows the increment developed and receives comments from stakeholders.

**Sprint Retrospective:**
Meeting at the end of each Sprint where the team reflects on its performance and seeks continuous improvements in its process.

**Increase:**
The result of the development team's work during a Sprint.
It must be functional and potentially deliverable at the end of each Sprint.

**Definition of Done (DoD):**
Criteria that an increase must meet to be considered "done."
Defines the quality standards that the team must maintain.

**Advantages of the Scrum methodology**
The Scrum methodology offers notable advantages in project management by providing flexibility to quickly adapt to changing requirements.  With short development cycles (Sprints), Scrum allows for incremental and continuous delivery of value to the customer, improving satisfaction and facilitating constant feedback.  Effective collaboration between the team, the Product Owner and stakeholders guarantees a shared understanding of objectives.  Additionally, Scrum establishes quality standards and proactively addresses risks, contributing to effective project management.  The methodology also boosts team efficiency and productivity by allowing autonomous decision-making, promoting team satisfaction and motivation.  In short, Scrum balances flexibility and discipline to achieve consistently successful results.

# DoD process
Prototype design:
A prototype is designed and documented according to established guidelines.
Reviews of the requirements have been carried out.

**1.Informal Tests:**
Informal tests have been created to cover new features or changes.
All Informal tests pass with flying colors.

**2.Continuous Integration:**
The prototype is successfully integrated into the main repository.
Go to another stage of improvements

**3.Product Review:**
The work has been reviewed with the Product Owner.
Adjustments have been made based on feedback from the Product Owner.

**4.Documentation:**
The prototype and user documentation has been updated as necessary.

**5.Performance:**
Necessary performance improvements have been addressed.

**6.Deployment:**
The implementation has been tested in a test environment.
A deployment guide has been provided.

**7.User Acceptance:**
End user acceptance has been obtained where applicable.
