# Product Evolution

## _Summary of completed product changes between the FIRST, SECOND and THIRD deliverables. Mention in synthesized form the most significant changes and that evidence is available._

### __Changes to the second installment__

The main idea of the product did not change between the first and the second release, however, some features were added and/or removed:
- Search history: the function for users to access a search history was added to the project to facilitate recipe tracking.
- AI training: this function was specified so that the AI can be trained with feedback from users.


In addition to the above, we also made the change from the agile methodology "Scrum" to the software life cycle model "Cascada", since with this project we will only cover up to the software design stage, opting for an easy to understand model such as Cascada to reach that stage.
In addition, with the mentioned changes the requirements list was refined, reducing the list to the most important functions of the product.

### __Changes to the third installment__

For the third release, the perspective of how the project will carry out its main function changed a bit, among other changes:
- Recipe search: in the second release the idea was that the product would generate food recipes instantly with the ingredients specified by the users, however, for the third release it was changed to the product searching for food recipes on the internet that meet the ingredients specified by the users, all this through an AI.
- Save recipes: a function was added so that the user can save the recipes searched by the AI.
- Weekly meal planning and budget: a function was added to the product in which meals and their costs can be planned at a set time.
- User routine: a function was added to the product to recommend recipes based on the user's daily routine.

In addition to the changes mentioned above, the final list of requirements was made, focusing on the most important functions for the product.
