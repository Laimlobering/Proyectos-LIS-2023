# Product Evolution

## _Summary of completed product changes between the FIRST, SECOND and THIRD deliverables. Mention in synthesized form the most significant changes and that evidence is available._

__Changes to the second installment__

The main idea of the product did not change between the first and the second release, however, some features were added and/or removed:
- Search history: the function for users to access a search history was added to the project to facilitate recipe tracking.
- AI training: this function was specified so that the AI can be trained with feedback from users.
In addition to the above, we also made the change from the agile methodology "Scrum" to the software life cycle model "Cascada", since with this project we will only cover up to the software design stage, opting for an easy to understand model such as Cascada to reach that stage.
In addition, with the mentioned changes the requirements list was refined, reducing the list to the most important functions of the product.
