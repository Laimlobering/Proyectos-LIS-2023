### __Primary Users__

We define primary users as university students in Yucatan; Likewise, we do not rule out expanding the accessibility of this product at a national level, with university students from other states being our secondary users.
### __Secondary users:__

Finally, our potential users are all those Mexicans who want to make use of the product. 
When defining university students in Yucat√°n as primary users, we identified their main characteristics, such as their eating habits, time and budget limitations, and lack of knowledge and/or experience in the kitchen, agreeing with the user profile of university students characterized mainly by lack of time and money; identifying scenarios where the student does not have enough time and/or knowledge to think about what to cook.
