### Software configuration management audit

The two artifacts selected for auditing are the use case diagram and the UI prototypes (wireframes)
The audit is performed to ensure the integrity and consistency of these elements and will be based on a series of "checklist" style questions for greater accuracy of the results.

## 1.	Use case diagram 

# Configuration
1.-Are all artifacts identified by name and relevant description? R=No
2.-Is there corresponding documentation for each artifact? R=Yes

# Versioning

3.-Are the artifacts version-controlled? R=Yes
4.-Are these versions identified by a specific tag? R=No
5.-Is the information handled in the artifacts consistent with that established in the documentation? R=Yes
6.-Are the artifacts related to your specific requirements? R=Yes

# Change management

7.-Have modifications been incorporated into the artifacts? R=Yes
8.-Have modifications/corrections been formally evaluated prior to approval? R=Yes
9.-Are the modifications recorded with date and author's name? R=No
10.-Are these changes organized in a history where the difference in versions is clearly visualized? R=No
11.-Were the modifications applied correctly? R=Yes
12.-Is there a formal process within the team for making changes to the diagram? R=No

## 2.	UI prototypes 

# Configuration
1.-Are all artifacts identified by name and relevant description? R=No
2.-Is there corresponding documentation for each artifact? R=Yes

#Versioning

3.-Are the artifacts version-controlled? R=Yes
4.-Are these versions identified by a specific tag? R=No
5.-Is the information handled in the artifacts consistent with that established in the documentation? R=Yes
6.-Are the artifacts related to your specific requirements? R=Yes

# Change management

7.-Have modifications been incorporated into the artifacts? R=Yes
8.-Have modifications/corrections been formally evaluated prior to approval? R=No
9.-Are the modifications recorded with date and author's name? R=No
10.-Are these changes organized in a history where the difference in versions is clearly visualized? R=Yes
11.-Were the modifications applied correctly? R=Yes
12.-Is there a formal process within the team for making changes to artifacts? R=No


## Conclusions
Based on the results of the audit, it is concluded that:

# 1. Informal and Inefficient Changes:
   The changes are currently made correctly but in an informal and inefficient manner. The suggestion is to establish a more formal and clear process for making changes. This proposed process should include specific details such as the name of the author of the change and the date it was made. Implementing such a process is expected to enhance the performance of modifications and improve control over the versioning of the artifacts

# 2. Lack of Artifact Identification: 
There is a deficiency in identifying artifacts, hindering their identification and traceability. It is essential to address this issue to ensure a more organized and manageable system.

# 3. Detailed Documentation:
The documentation related to artifacts and their contents is correctly detailed, maintaining a proper relationship between requirements and artifacts. This aspect of the project is already in good shape.

# 4. Issues with Artifact Versioning: 
Although the artifacts are correctly versioned, there is a lack of proper organization and labeling. This deficiency could lead to difficulties in recovering specific versions. Implementing a structured organization and labeling system for versions is suggested to mitigate this potential problem.

If all these points are correctly addressed, the artifact project would present an organizational improvement, improving the control and traceability that we have over it.
