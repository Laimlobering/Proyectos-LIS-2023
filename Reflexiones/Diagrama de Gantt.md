## GANTT CHART

For this third delivery, that is, the third sprint, a span of 20 days was allocated. Initially, a team member divided the tasks or activities that each team member would carry out. We began by completing the key or foundational activities to pave the way for subsequent tasks. The term "foundation" is used because these activities are crucial for accomplishing the following aspects of the work, such as the video for the third delivery.

The objective of creating the Gantt chart is to facilitate learning and to use it as a tool. It provides a more organized visualization of the workflow and the organizational structure defined for each activity, including the division of responsibilities. Some tasks were executed by one, two, three, or even the entire team.

As, by the time of this third and final delivery, we had gained more knowledge and a solid foundation for the work, the tasks were more about refining the previous ones. Consequently, each task did not take too much time to complete.

### The Chart:
The Gantt chart is arranged in a column of tasks alongside those responsible for them. There is a row of dates from November 20 to December 10, which is the final delivery date. The start and end of each task can be observed to understand the distribution of dates better. The chart is based on a 5-day interval to enhance clarity in the depiction of the timeline.
