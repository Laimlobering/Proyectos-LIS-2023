Indicators were established to determine the degree of achievement of the requirements. Upon analyzing them for each test conducted, we realize that in tests 1 "Registration," 2 "Login," 3 "Update Profile," 4 "Delete Profile," 6 "Save Recipes," and 7 "User Feedback," the level of understanding of what needed to be done is high. This is because these actions are ones our users (university students in Yucat√°n) are very familiar with due to their daily use in activities such as social media, email, etc.

In test 5 "Filters and Recipe Search," we obtained a good response from users. The app is interactive enough for users to carry out this process smoothly. However, users had a couple of questions about the differences between the recipe search methods.

The major issue encountered was in test 8 "Meal Planning and Budgets." This was the test in which more doubts arose, and it took more time. This resulted from it being a relatively novel and, therefore, an uncommon process. Users had questions about the process and what should be done in certain steps.

From the above, we can infer that the degree of compliance with the requirements is high for the majority of them, as they were executed with relative ease. Based on the test information and satisfaction questionnaire, the need for clearer instructions in the interfaces was identified, mainly in the process covered by test 8 "Meal Planning and Budgets." In this process (test 8), the need to improve the flow of the process was also identified by adding and modifying steps to make it simpler.

Finally, there was an identified need for a more colorful and appealing app.
